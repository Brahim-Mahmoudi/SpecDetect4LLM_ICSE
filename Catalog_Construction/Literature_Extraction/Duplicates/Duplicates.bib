  abstract={The recent achievements and availability of Large Language Models have paved the road to a new range of applications and use-cases. Pre-trained language models are now being involved at-scale in many fields where they were until now absent from. More specifically, the progress made by causal generative models has open the door to using them through textual instructions aka. prompts. Unfortunately, the performances of these prompts are highly dependent on the exact phrasing used and therefore practitioners need to adopt fail-retry strategies. This first international workshop on prompt engineering aims at gathering practitioners (both from Academia and Industry) to exchange about good practices, optimizations, results and novel paradigms about the design of efficient prompts to make use of LLMs.},

  abstract={God classes are widely recognized as code smells, significantly impairing the maintainability and readability of source code. However, resolving the identified God classes remains a formidable challenge, and we still lack automated and accurate tools to resolve God classes automatically. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach (called ClassSplitter) to decompose God classes. The key observation behind the proposed approach is that software entities (i.e., methods and fields) that are physically adjacent often have strong semantic correlations and thus have a great chance of being classified into the same class during God class deposition. We validate this hypothesis by analyzing 54 God class decomposition refactorings actually conducted in the wild. According to the observation, we measure the similarity between software entities by exploiting not only traditional code metrics but also their relative physical positions. Based on the similarity, we customize a clustering algorithm to classify the methods within a given God class, and each of the resulting clusters is taken as a new class. Finally, ClassSplitter allocates the fields of the God class to the new classes according to the field-access-based coupling between fields and classes. We evaluate ClassSplitter using 133 real-world God classes from open-source applications. Our evaluation results suggest that ClassSplitter could substantially improve the state of the art in God class decomposition, improving the average MoJoFM by 47%. Manual evaluation also confirmed that in most cases (77%) the solutions suggested by ClassSplitter were preferred by developers to alternatives suggested by the state-of-the-art baseline approach.},

  abstract={Troubleshooting trees are essential tools for industrial diagnostics, providing a structured framework for fault detection and resolution in complex systems. Construction of a new troubleshooting tree requires a systematic approach that integrates domain expertise, beginning with a comprehensive analysis of system architecture, operational parameters, and documented failure modes. However, the traditional development of troubleshooting trees is a labor-intensive process that relies heavily on expert knowledge, a large number of highly technical design documents, and iterative refinement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate troubleshooting trees using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) documentation as the primary input. The proposed method employs an LLM-based framework to extract and organize failure-related information from FMEA records, translating it into structured troubleshooting logic. Additionally, the framework introduces the possibility of including domain knowledge using a human-in-the-loop verification process, which also ensures traceability by linking each generated node to its source and enhances explainability through expert feedback consolidation. Experiments conducted on multiple FMEA documents demonstrate that the framework achieves an average coverage rate of 96.9%, with troubleshooting node precision exceeding 96% and a hallucination rate below 4% in most cases. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based pipelines in automating structured fault analysis, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional manual troubleshooting tree development.},

  abstract={Substations, as crucial components of the power system, play a vital role in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of smart grids. Traditional substation modeling methods often rely on manual operations, suffering from issues such as long modeling cycles, low accuracy, and poor collaboration. However, with the rapid development of information technology, particularly the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies, new solutions for substation modeling have emerged. This paper primarily investigates an architecture that combines Large Language Model (LLM) with intelligent agents, utilizing large models to construct an intelligent agent system. This system is trained to recognize two-dimensional drawings and employs intelligent agents to invoke Revit tools for three- dimensional BIM modeling of substations. Compared to traditional modeling methods, this approach significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of substation modeling while reducing modeling costs, promising to accelerate the development of smart grid construction. Therefore, the automatic BIM modeling method for substations using LLM intelligent agents holds broad application prospects and development potential in modern smart grid construction.},

  abstract={The failure rate is a reliability evaluation parameter based on probability in the power system. It is very important to calculate the reliability index and the equipment fault loss through the failure rate for the planning and operation of the power system. A failure model of large transformer failure rate is proposed. Firstly, the failure rate model of the transformer is established, and the current failure rate and running state of the transformer are obtained. Secondly, a multi-state Markov failure rate prediction model is established to predict the real-time failure rate of the transformer. Finally, the proportional failure rate model of aging failure process to correct the current state of the transfer rate of transformer, and then on the basis of a more accurate transformer real-time prediction failure rate. Example analysis results show that the multi-state Markov failure rate prediction model can be modified by the aging failure model, and the real - time failure rate can be predicted more accurately.},

From the investigations on the measurement of the frequency characteristics of transformer windings and detailed lightning surge analysis used by Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP), it was found that resonance overvoltages were generated by resonance phenomena between the surge waveform passing through the transformer and the natural frequency characteristics of the transformer winding. This finding was used to improve the winding form of tap windings and install a surge protection device between tap windings. After the improvement of winding structures, it was clearly shown that the internal stress of tap windings was reduced and the breakdown probability of the damaged part was significantly reduced.},

  abstract={This paper delves into the establishment of a robust LLMOps framework, crucial for intelligent automation in modern enterprises. LLMOps for intelligent automation platforms require composability and capability to use different architectures, embeddings, and Generative AI models seamlessly with domain focus. In this paper we discuss an architecture we designed for UST SmartOps, UST's Intelligent Automation platform, keeping automation at its core. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI capabilities in natural language processing and understanding, but their deployment and management, integration and using them effectively for automation use cases pose unique challenges. LLMOps, similar to DevOps and MLOps, is dedicated to the operationalization of these models, addressing infrastructure, performance optimization, security, and continuous improvement. The paper outlines the strategies and best practices essential for LLMOps, emphasizing data management, model monitoring, and the integration of AI with automation to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making processes. Through systematic orches-tration of tools, processes, and infrastructure, the document aims to provide a comprehensive guide to effectively leverage LLMs within intelligent automation frameworks.},

  abstract={SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are essential for verifying Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, as they can be embedded into key functional paths to detect unintended behaviours. During simulation, assertion failures occur when the design’s behaviour deviates from expectations. Solving these failures, i.e., identifying and fixing the issues causing the deviation, requires analysing complex logical and timing relationships between multiple signals. This process heavily relies on human expertise, and there is currently no automatic tool available to assist with it. Here, we present AssertSolver, an opensource Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for solving assertion failures. By leveraging synthetic training data and learning from error responses to challenging cases, AssertSolver achieves a bug-fixing pass@1 metric of $88.54 \%$ on our testbench, significantly outperforming OpenAI’s o1-preview by up to $\mathbf{1 1. 9 7 \%}$. We release our model and testbench for public access to encourage further research: https://github.com/SEU-ACAL/reproduce-AssertSolver-DAC-25.},

  abstract={Technical debt prediction involves anticipating prob-lems and challenges in software projects. Because of lousy coding choices, these projects are often far from the optimal design. These issues can accumulate over time and affect long-term maintainability and stability. Numerous studies are available for predicting technical debt. For instance, some studies utilize static analysis tools like Pylint11https://pypi.org/project/pylint/, and others use dynamic code analysis tools like SZZ [1]. This study addresses AI predictions using data obtained from static analysis tools. This paper presents technical debt prediction using static code analysis data generated with SonarQube22https://docs.sonarsource.com!sonarqube/latest/ and Radon33https://pypi.org/project/radon/. It covers both short-term and long-term predictions by analyzing code quality metrics such as complexity, duplication, and adherence to standards. The study also integrates git commit classification to analyze commit history, providing valuable insights into the evolution and management of technical debt within the project.},

  abstract={In this paper, a model developed for a transformer monitoring system to estimate transformer tank vibration is presented. The model calculates vibration on the transformer tank starting from some input variables that can be easily measured on the transformer. Tank vibration is also measured, showing a good concordance between estimated and measured values if the transformer is healthy. In case of a winding deformation winding vibration and, consequently, that of the tank, changes and a big difference between estimated and measured vibration appear. To estimate tank vibration, the model takes into account the main physical phenomena generating vibrations in the different transformer elements and how these vibrations are superposed and transmitted to the tank. The model has been tested experimentally on a test transformer fitted with internal and external accelerometers. A deformation has been provoked in the test transformer winding with the aim of testing the model's ability to detect it. The model has been also tested on several in-service grid transformers. The results of the experimental validation are shown in Part II of the paper.},

  abstract={This paper describes a probabilistic method based on Markov models for assessing the number of spare transformers, regular units and mobile units, required for a group of distribution transformers. The proposed method uses two criteria in determining the required number of spare transformers. The first criterion assumes that a pre-determined level of the group availability is given and the number of spare units is determined when the calculated group availability exceeds the pre-determined level of the group availability. The second criterion uses a cost/benefit analysis method in calculating the number of the spare units. In the second criterion, the number of spare units (optimal number) is determined when the total cost (spare unit capital costs and unit outage costs) is minimum. The proposed method is also used to evaluate the impacts of multi-transformer stations (stations with transformer redundancy) and station capabilities for use of mobile unit transformers on the number of spare units. Two distribution transformer groups of the Hydro One's distribution system are used to illustrate the proposed method of assessment and to compare the results obtained using the two criteria.},

  abstract={Transformer failures have in recent years led to the development of Resistor-Capacitor snubber circuits for the protection of the transformer and winding insulation from the damaging effects of highvoltage high-frequency transients. Transformer insulation may be damaged if the Basic Insulation Level (BIL) is exceeded, turn-to-turn insulation when there is excessive rate of change of voltage with time (dv/dt), and to switching devices by restrikes when the Transient Recovery Voltage (TRV) is exceeded. These transients are most often observed when dry-type transformers are close coupled to vacuum switching devices. Some manufacturers are now including snubbers in their transformer designs. This paper provides a thorough review of the causes of the transients, methods of analysis, and mitigation of the effects of these transients. An example is provided of transformers to be installed in the basement of an urban high rise office building, where the space is limited and the available fault current is high, where the transformer enclosure includes built-in snubber circuits. The strengths and weaknesses of current methods are examined. Recommendations are made for improvements in snubber circuit design and analysis.},

  abstract={Statistical lifetime models are regarded as an important part of the replacement management of power transformers. The development of transformer lifetime models, however, is hindered by the lack of failure data since most of the transformer fleets have not yet completed their first lifecycle. As researchers realized the importance of survival data, lots of lifetime models are developed based on failure data together with survival data. This paper analyzes the effect of survival data on the accuracy of lifetime models through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. It has been proved that the accuracy of lifetime models can be improved by taking the survival data into account. However, the degree of improvement is greatly confined by the censoring rate and the sample size of the collected lifetime data. Practical implications of the simulation results and suggestions on measures to further improve the accuracy of lifetime models are subsequently provided.},

The analysis also determined that the close-coupled power transformers were also in jeopardy. Field inspections involving grounding improvements coupled with solution simulations were made. High-speed switching transient measurements were performed to verify the analysis and the surge protective device solution (arresters and snubbers).

In this way, the present paper deals with the high-frequency leakage currents in ac motors fed by pulsewidth-modulation inverters, contextualized in the analysis of an actual case. From the parameters of an equivalent circuit representing the connecting cable, motor, and inverter return path, a filter, characterized by a common-mode transformer, is designed to mitigate the common-mode quantities and the correlated problems. Both simulated and experimental results show that the proposed solution represents an advantageous alternative in comparison to the traditional  $RC$ and  $RLC$ filters, since, in addition to its effect on the common-mode quantities, it dissipates a negligible amount of power.},

  abstract={This paper presents a case study of an overhead distribution feeder in a very high keraunic area. The feeder was experiencing approximately twice the number of lightning caused transformer failures per year than any other distribution feeder in the area. In an attempt to lower the outage rate and the repair costs, the lightning protection for this feeder was studied and a new protection system was installed. This paper discusses the outage history of this feeder and existing transformer overvoltage protection. It then details the steps that were taken to improve the protection so acceptable customer service could be achieved. The interruption data results for one year after the protection changes were implemented are then presented. The results from the field trial of the new lightning protection scheme exhibit a significant improvement in the feeder service reliability. A compilation of teardown data of failed distribution transformers is also presented. The analysis includes failed transformers from the study feeder, and failed transformers from the same utility, but not part of the feeder study. The causes of the transformer failures were tabulated. The results from the teardowns indicate that a high percentage of distribution transformers with interlaced and noninterlaced secondary windings fail from low-side voltage surges.<>},

  abstract={Code intelligence tools such as GitHub Copilot have begun to bridge the gap between natural language and programming language. A frequent software development task is the management of technical debts, which are suboptimal solutions or unaddressed issues which hinder future software development. Developers have been found to “self-admit” technical debts (SATD) in software artifacts such as source code comments. Thus, is it possible that the information present in these comments can enhance code generative prompts to repay the described SATD? Or, does the inclusion of such comments instead cause code generative tools to reproduce the harmful symptoms of described technical debt? Does the modification of SATD impact this reaction? Despite the heavy maintenance costs caused by technical debt and the recent improvements of code intelligence tools, no prior works have sought to incorporate SATD towards prompt engineering. Inspired by this, this paper contributes and analyzes a dataset consisting of 36,381 TODO comments in the latest available revisions of their respective 102,424 repositories, from which we sample and manually generate 1,140 code bodies using GitHub Copilot. Our experiments show that GitHub Copilot can generate code with the symptoms of SATD, both prompted and unprompted. Moreover, we demonstrate the tool's ability to automatically repay SATD under different circumstances and qualitatively investigate the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful comments. Finally, we discuss gaps in which GitHub Copilot's successors and future researchers can improve upon code intelligence tasks to facilitate AI-assisted software maintenance.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have become increasingly central to software development, enhancing efficiency with tools such as intelligent code assistants and driving innovations in products like chatbots, recommendation engines, and predictive analytics. Despite these advancements, the inherent complexity of AI-integrated software projects often leads to the accumulation of technical debt (TD), which can compromise the reliability and sustainability of systems in the long term. Managing TD effectively in these projects can be achieved by adapting international standards. Although these standards are not designed for TD management, they can be systematically applied to detect and address TD by aligning with AI system lifecycle processes. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how AI-related TD correlates with various AI lifecycle processes, thereby enabling systematic detection and management of TD in AI-integrated software projects. To achieve this, we studied 73 unique cases of TD, each reflecting either an instance or a root cause of data-related TD. These cases were subsequently mapped to the processes and activities outlined in the ISO/IEC 5338 AI Systems Lifecycle Processes standard. Subsequently, the accuracy of these mappings was validated bidirectionally by a large language model and two domain experts. Our findings revealed that data-related TD categories are associated with a diverse range of processes such as design definition, quality management and human resource management and tend to accumulate more significantly in certain areas within the AI lifecycle. This study not only serves as a proof of concept for developing a management approach for AI-related TD, but also enhances the body of knowledge on managing TD in AI projects by detailing how TD interacts with and impacts various AI lifecycle processes.},
